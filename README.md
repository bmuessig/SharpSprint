# SharpSprint
Library for the Text-IO interface to SprintLayout

This C# library and accompanging test suite is designed to provide an easy to use, but powerful interface to the popular
SprintLayout PCB CAD program developed by the German engineering company Abacom.

It allows programmatically creating objects, components and entire designs and exports them to a format compatible for opening
with SprintLayout.

The interface is specifically tailored for use with SprintLayout version 6 and onwards.

Project ideas for use of this library include special placements of components in mathematical functions,
auto-generation of LED signs, export of SprintLayout files to SVG, import of models of other CAD packages into SprintLayout.
